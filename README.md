## Architecture
We use one of the most advanced and high-level architectures for iOS projects called: Clean Swift.<br/>
Clean Swift (shortly VIP) is Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture adapted to iOS and macOS projects.<br/>

In our project each screen is a module called a Scene, and is divided into 6 entities:
* View
* Interactor
* Presenter
* Router
* Model
* Worker

Each Scene will have their independent storyboard file if need and looks like this:<br/>
*(As an exmaple Welcome Screen was taken)*

* WelcomeWorker.swift
* WelcomeModels.swift
* WelcomeRouter.swift
* WelcomePresenter.swift
* WelcomeInteractor.swiftw
* WelcomeViewController.swift
* WelcomeViewController.storyboard

In addition to the Scenes in the project, there are also general categories that are shared/common for all Scenes, such as: Constants, Managers, Services, Models, Views, Extensions and Resources.
